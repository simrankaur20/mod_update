								With each menstrual cycle, the endometrium (uterine lining) prepares itself to nourish a fetus. If fertilization doesnâ€™t occur, the body sheds the endometrium during the monthly (on average) cycle. In some cases, an irregularity can occur in this cycle, indicating any of the following menstrual disorders:
<br><br><br>
<h2>Types of Menstrual Disorders</h2>
<ul>
<li>Amenorrhea</li>
<li>Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS)</li>
<li>Dysmenorrhea</li>
<li>Menorrhagia</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS)</h2>
PMS is any unpleasant or uncomfortable symptom during your cycle that may temporarily disturb normal functioning. These symptoms may last from a few hours to many days, and the types and intensity of symptoms can vary in individuals. 

Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) is a much more severe form of PMS which affects approximately 3%-8% of women of reproductive age. PMDD requires treatment by a physician. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, nearly 85% of women experience at least one common symptom associated with PMS during their reproductive years. An estimated 5% have symptoms so extreme they are disabled by the condition.

PMS Symptoms
Although each individual may experience symptoms differently, the most common symptoms of PMS can include any of the following:
<ul>
<li>Psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, irritability)</li>
<li>Gastrointestinal symptoms (bloating)</li>
<li>Fluid retention (swelling of fingers, ankles and feet)</li>
<li>Skin problems (acne)
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Vertigo</li>
<li>Fainting</li>
<li>Muscle spasms</li>
<li>Heart palpitations</li>
<li>Allergies</li>
<li>Infections</li>
<li>Vision problems</li>
<li>Eye infections</li>
<li>Decreased coordination</li>
<li>Diminished libido (sex drive)</li>
<li>Changes in appetite</li>
<li>Hot flashes</li>
</ul>
Simple modifications in lifestyle can help eliminate or reduce the severity of symptoms, including:
<br>
Exercising 3 to 5 times each week<br>
Eating a well-balanced diet that includes whole grains, vegetables and fruit, and a decreasing salt, sugar, caffeine and alcohol intake
<br>Getting adequate sleep and rest
<br><br><br>
<h2>Amenorrhea</h2>
Amenorrhea is characterized by absent menstrual periods for more than three monthly menstrual cycles. There are two types of amenorrhea:

<h3>Types of Amenorrhea</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Primary amenorrhea: Menstruation does not begin at puberty.</li>
<li>Secondary amenorrhea: Normal and regular menstrual periods which become increasingly abnormal and irregular or absent. This may be due to a physical cause typically of later onset.</li>
</ul>
Amenorrhea can occur for a number of reasons as part of the normal course of life, such as pregnancy, breast-feeding or menopause. Or, it may occur as a result of medications or a medical problem including:
<ul>
<li>Ovulation abnormality</li>
<li>Birth defect, anatomical abnormality or other medical condition</li>
<li>Eating disorder</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
<li>Excessive or strenuous exercise</li>
<li>Thyroid disorder</li>
</ul>
If at least three consecutive menstrual periods are missed or if you've never had a menstrual period and are 16 years or older, it is important to see a healthcare professional. As with any condition, early diagnosis and treatment is very important.
<br><br><br>
<h2>Dysmenorrhea</h2>
Dysmenorrhea is characterized by severe and frequent menstrual cramps and pain associated with menstruation. The cause of dysmenorrhea is dependent on if the condition is primary or secondary. With primary dysmenorrheal, women experience abnormal uterine contractions resulting from a chemical imbalance in the body. Secondary dysmenorrhea is caused by other medical conditions, most often endometriosis. Other possible causes may include: 
<ul>
<li>pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)</li>
<li>uterine fibroids</li>
<li>abnormal pregnancy (i.e., miscarriage, ectopic)</li>
<li>infection, tumors, or polyps in the pelvic cavity</li>
</ul>
Any woman can develop dysmenorrhea, but those who are at an increased risk include:
<ul>
<li>Smokers</li>
<li>Those who consume excessive alcohol during their period</li>
<li>Women who are overweight</li>
<li>Women who started menstruating before the age of 11</li>
</ul>
Dysmenorrhea Symptoms
The most common symptoms may include:
<ul>
<li>Cramping or pain in the lower abdomen</li>
<li>Low back pain or pain radiating down the legs</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Vomiting</li>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Weakness</li>
<li>Fainting</li>
<li>Headaches</li>
<li>Menorrhagia</li>
<li>Menorrhagia is the most common type of abnormal uterine bleeding and is characterized by heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding. In some cases, bleeding may be so severe that daily activities are disrupted.
</li>
</ul>
