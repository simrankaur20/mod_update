					<h1>Modules of Menstrual Cycle</h1>
					<p>
							Menstruation, or period, is normal vaginal bleeding that occurs as part of a woman's monthly cycle. Every month, your body prepares for pregnancy. If no pregnancy occurs, the uterus, or womb, sheds its lining. The menstrual blood is partly blood and partly tissue from inside the uterus. It passes out of the body through the vagina.

								<h3>ALL ABOUT MENSTRUATION</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>
												<h4>INFORMATION</a></h4>
												<p>
														Medically, menstruation (also termed period or bleeding) is the process in a woman of discharging (through the vagina) blood and other materials from the lining of the uterus at about one monthly interval from puberty until menopause (ceasing of regular menstrual cycles), except during pregnancy. This discharging process lasts about 3-5 days.

										<h4>DO'S AND  DONT'S</a></h4>
										
										<p>
											People around the world are denied access to the resources they need to manage their periods, and it impacts not only their health, but their self esteem, education, and economic empowerment.

I consider the first step to feeling empowered and confident on *any* subject to be getting educated, and when it comes to women’s health, especially reproductive health, it can be difficult – there’s a ton of misinformation out there from whether or not hymens exist (or matter) to whether you should wash your vagina with soap (spoiler alert: DON’T).
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h4>MENSTRUAL DISORDERS</a></h4>
										<p>
											With each menstrual cycle, the endometrium (uterine lining) prepares itself to nourish a fetus. If fertilization doesn’t occur, the body sheds the endometrium during the monthly (on average) cycle.
